      <h2>What is it?</h2>

      <p>Spec.pm is a tool for writing product requirements. Itâ€™s a structured wiki that is specifically designed for
        product and development teams.  It syncs with Pivotal Tracker so you don't have to manually break your spec into tickets. </p>

      <p>It's used to communicate a complex feature to a development team.  A collection of user stories that make up a complex feature is called an epic.
        Spec.pm is for writing the user stories that make up an epic. <%= link_to "Learn how to write a spec.", public_how_to_path %>
      </p>

      <h2>Why would I use it?</h2>

      <dt>Epics are best understood when read in a single document</dt>

      <dd>It is very difficult for a development team to understand an epic when the underlying stories have already
        been broken into tickets. It's much easier to understand how all the parts fit together when read in a single
        Spec.pm document.
      </dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Front and backend stories are best understood when side-by-side</dt>
      <dd>If developers are not full stack, it's hard for the backend developer to understand exactly what the frontend
        developer needs. Side-by-side stories solves this.
      </dd>
      <br>
      <dt>Order stories for comprehension, not development priority.</dt>
      <dd>Stories are usually prioritized in the order that developers should work on them. This is generally not the
        best order for explaining how a feature works. Use Spec.pm to order stories in way that best conveys how the feature will work.
      </dd>
      <br>

      <dt>A spec doubles as documentation.</dt>

      <dd> Looking back at a spec is a great way to remember how software was built. It helps new developers get up to
        speed, and it helps existing developers remember the decisions that were made in the past.
      </dd>
      </dl>

      <h2>How does it work?</h2>

      <p>A spec is made up of stories</p>
      <%= image_tag "story_list.png", class: "img-rounded img-responsive"  %>

      <h2>Adding a story</h2>

      <p>When you add a story, it's pre-populated with three sections. User Story, Logic, and Acceptance Criteria.
        <%= link_to "Learn about these sections.", public_how_to_path(:anchor => "sections") %> </p>
      <%= image_tag "add_story.png", class: "img-rounded img-responsive" %>

      <h2>Splitting Frontend & Backend</h2>

      <p>Spliting a story into frontend and backend is useful when the development team isn't full stack.  This is especially true when doing mobile development.</p>
      <%= image_tag "front_back.png", class: "img-rounded img-responsive"  %>

      <h2>Rearranging</h2>

      <p>You can drag and drop stories around the page. A spec is like a narrative you are telling the developers. Order
        your stories in a way that allows them to fully grasp how all the stories work together.</p>
      <%= image_tag "rearrange.png", class: "img-rounded img-responsive"  %>

      <h2>Sync With Pivotal Tracker</h2>

      <p>When you sync, all stories are added to a Pivotal Tracker project.  Any change to a story in Pivotal Tracker automatically updates the story in Spec.pm, and vice versa. This keeps the spec up-to-date, increasing it's utility as documentation.</p>
      <%= image_tag "sync.png", class: "img-rounded img-responsive"  %>

      <h2>About SPEC.PM</h2>

      <p>This app is largely based on 37 Signals Backpack. A phenomenal product that was <a
      href="http://37signals.com/backpack-retired">recently shut down to new users.</a>

        I used Backpack for all my spec writing so I built Spec.pm to replace it. <br><br>

        I also teach a class on <a href="https://generalassemb.ly/instructors/jason-schwartz/395">Product Management</a>.  I built Spec.pm as a teaching aide for new product managers
        as well as a functional utility.<br><br>

        <a href="mailto:j.schwartz4+spec@gmail.com">Feedback is welcome.</a> The <a href="https://github.com/jschwa/spec_writer">Github repo for this project is
        here</a> if you wish to make modifications.<br><br>
